This project is an introduction to deep learning tools for Image Processing. You will experiment and train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image classification using PyTorch. Specifically, in this assignment, you will experiment with various CNN architectures using PyTorch to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset.

You will first explore the architecture of a Simple CNN to understand its key components and what each of them do. You will be introduced to certain terms - convolutional layers, activation functions, pooling layers, etc. - and how they work together to extract features from images. Essentially, you will develop an understanding of how a CNN works.

Your first task will be to implement a basic CNN from scratch, and also understand how each layer processes the input images & data and contributes to the overall performance of the model. You will train your CNN on the Fashion MNIST dataset, which contains greyscale images of clothing items, and evaluate its performance in terms of classification of a test set.

Next, you will explore hyperparameter tuning of CNN models. You will experiment with different architectures of CNNs and observe the resulting effects in model performance.

By the end of this assignment, you are expected to have a solid understanding of how to implement and train CNNs for image classification tasks. This project will prepare you for more advanced deep learning applications, enabling you to tackle real-world computer vision challenges with confidence.
